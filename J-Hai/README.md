# LAB03: jQuery Events

**Author**: Hai and J
**Version**: 1.0.3

## Overview
Lab 03 project provides the developer with the opportunity to utilize template literal and implement handles to the blog. Implementing handles to the articleView provides the developer with pushing vital information to the user. Overall, the end result is a working blog with the use of two categories that are interchangeable.

## Getting Started
Review all materials and TODO acknowledging the start point between driver and navigator.  Understanding what the functionality of the site is and how to approach it correctly. Knowledge of jquery, HTML, and CSS are all required to complete this app.

## Architecture
The application is simple and elegant for the user to navigate via a drop-down menu with Authors and Categories displaying only the selected article. Additionally, if the user selects a specific article, that person may view additional information beyond the basics. The languages utilized throughout this code are JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the addition of the jquery library.
